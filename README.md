# SecantApprox

In this project, a neural network capable of approximating the secant function using training data derived from analytical reference values was implemented in Python 3, using TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy. This implementation seeks to explore how the depth and width of the neural network impact the precision of the approximation. For this purpose, the disparity in exerimental and analytical values, as well as loss progression, was evaluated and compared for each tested depth and width.
